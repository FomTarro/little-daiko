# little-daiko
A Discord bot for integrating with the [mildom.com](https://www.mildom.com) streaming platform.
 
## About
Named after the digital persona of beloved mildom streamer [kson](https://www.mildom.com/10882672), this bot was built to help facilitate the enjoyment of her streams by her western fans. 
 
To that end, this bot seeks to achieve two primary goals:
1) To provide go-live alerts for a designated streamer by pinging a designated role, and posting the alert in a designated Discord channel.
2) To transmit translation messages from designated "trusted chat members" that are prefixed with a translation indicator (such as `[EN]`) into a designated Discord channel. 
 
## Contact
 
This bot is built and managed by Tom "Skeletom" Farro. If you need to contact him, the best way to do so is via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/fomtarro) or by leaving an issue ticket on this repo. Currently, this bot is not available for public deployment, but may become public in the near future.
 
# Usage
 
While it was built with kson in mind, it can be configured by server operators to work with any mildom streamer's channel. 
 
In addition, there is no limit to the number of `[language : Discord channel]` pairs for translation message transmission. This means that you can have seperate output channels for `[EN]`, `[ES]`, `[JP]`, `[ITA]`, etc.
