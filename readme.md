# little-daiko
A Discord bot for integrating with the [mildom.com](https://www.mildom.com) streaming platform.
 
## About
Named after the digital persona of beloved Mildom streamer [kson](https://www.mildom.com/10882672), this bot was built to help facilitate the enjoyment of her streams by her fans abroad. 
 
To that end, this bot seeks to achieve three primary goals:
1) To provide go-live alerts for a designated streamer by pinging a designated role, and posting the alert in a designated Discord channel.
2) To transmit translation messages from designated "trusted chat members" that are prefixed with a translation indicator (such as `[EN]`) into a designated Discord channel. 
3) To allow users to mark timestamps for noteworthy moments during a stream, which will be summarized in a log file at the end of the stream.
 
## Contact
 
This bot is built and managed by Tom "Skeletom" Farro. If you need to contact him, the best way to do so is via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/fomtarro) or by leaving an issue ticket on this repo. Currently, this bot is not available for public deployment, but may become public in the near future.
 
# Usage
 
While it was built with kson in mind, it can be configured by server operators to work with any Mildom streamer's channel. 

Like most Discord bots, this one is controlled via commands.

Commands can be invoked by starting a message with a designated prefix (`!` by default), or by mentioning the bot with the desired command.
 
## Live Translation / Message Transmission

The bot can handle the transmission of translated messages for as many languages as are desired. Each language can be configured to transmit into a designated channel using the `output` command.

For example, let's run the following command:
```
!output chat add en stream-chat-en
```
This will configure the bot to transmit messages from [specified chat members](#users) that are prefixed with `[en]` (case does not matter) into the Discord channel named `stream-chat-en`.

You can then repeat this process for as many languages as you see fit.

## Listening

To get the bot to start listening for chat messages and go-live notifications for a stream, first designate the stream to listen to with the following command:
```
!streamer 123456
```
This will have the bot listen to the Mildom channel ID `123456`, when the bot is active. Next, let's activate the bot with the following command: 
```
!start
```
The bot should now be set to listen to the channel forever. If for some reason you wish to stop listening, simply stop it with the following command:
```
!stop
```

If the bot is currently listening, it will include `ðŸŸ¢` in its display name. If it is not listening, it will instead include `ðŸ”´`.
